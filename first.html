<p style="font-size:20px;">I am a person who have always wanted to stand out from the crowd ,even in little things.
If given a regular path which everyone chooses and a difficult yet different path i might 
choose the difficult one just because i want to be unique.And I could make fun of myself 
all day everyday. I think that makes me quite unique as everyone is busy praising themselves
 in this competitive yet beautiful world.My biggest achievement till date will be the moment 
 i got a cgpa of 10 in my 10th board exams.I am not sure if this is considered a talent but yeah,
 <b>i can solve Rubikâ€™s cube and also i can juggle.</b>My hobbies include playing badminton, cooking food
 and watching Television.</p>
